# AutoHotkey scripts

These are the [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts that I always have running. 

The entry point is [Main.ahk](). I have a shortcut to this file in my Windows startup folder. 

There are two main categories: 

- [Hotkeys](hotkeys.ahk) are keyboard shortcuts (mostly using the Windows logo key).
- [Text expansions](expansion.ahk) are snippets of text that expand into larger chunks of text.
